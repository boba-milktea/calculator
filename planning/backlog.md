# Backlog

A collection of user stories you can choose from. Stories inside each priority
level are not necessarily in orderâ€”it's up to you to decide how they fit into your
strategy.
These are also just suggestions, so feel free to change them or create your own!

## Must-Haves

> These are necessary for basic usability.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, and division) so that I can complete simple
      calculations easily.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want a clear and easy-to-read display so that I can see
      the numbers and results without confusion.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want a button to clear all inputs so that I can quickly
      reset the calculator when I make a mistake.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want responsive buttons for numbers and operations so that
      I can use the calculator on both desktop and mobile devices.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want the calculator to handle errors (e.g., division by
      zero) so that I get meaningful feedback instead of breaking the app.

## Should-Haves

> These improve the user experience but aren't strictly necessary for basic functionality.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want hover effects on buttons so that I can easily identify
      which button I'm about to click.

## Could-Haves

> These are nice-to-have features that can be added later.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want keyboard input support so that I can use my keyboard
      for faster calculations.

- [ ] As a **user**, I want to see the history of my previous calculations so
      that I can refer back to earlier results.
